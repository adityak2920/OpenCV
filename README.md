# OpenCV
In these algorithms we can see what can we do using OpenCV
here are some of the screenshots from the result of opencv:

You can the results of background subtraction those results with some line of code will definitely blow your mind.

Note: In the files the lines of code which are commented out we can also use them for the results those are just operations to do the same work as the lines of code are performing.
